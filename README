A protocol implementation to connect to QWebIRC, in the case where you absolutely need to.

Running examples/relay.py causes it to listen on 127.0.0.1:6667, and when you connect, it will tunnel your connection to qwebirc, handy for irc servers that only offer webirc and you want to use a non-web client.

Alternatively, if you run setup.py, it installs webirc-relay, and you can just use that.
